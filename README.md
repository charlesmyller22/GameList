# Game list

# About the project

Game list is a project where we'll be creating a list of games and write descriptions about them. 
We'll also be able to select a game and change its position by dragging them to the desired position. 
Even though it's a backend project, I will soon integrate it with ReactJS, TypeScript, Bootstrap and all that frontend stuff, turning it into then a fullstack application.
The deployment will be done soon with CI/CD and we'll have a local environment with Docker compose. 
The API will also pass through some tests with RestAssured and Jacoco.
